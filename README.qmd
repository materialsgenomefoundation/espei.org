# espei.org Quarto site

## TODO:
- fix cross-reference links
- Changelog
- API docs
- Make pages dynamic that run actual code, rather than static
- Update png logos to the versions with transparency
- Integrate previously external content (e.g. from workshops (2022 Cr-Ni, 2023 Cu-Mg), custom parameters gists)
- Recipes: does it make sense to convert them to be more self-contained, since they use different data?
