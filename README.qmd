# espei.org Quarto site

## Building the docs
1. Install `quarto` from [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt` (installs ESPEI and `quartodoc`)
3. `quartodoc build` to generate `reference/api` docs
4. `quartodoc preview` (or your preferred command)

## TODO:
- fix cross-reference links
- Changelog
- Get CLI documented
- API docs:
  - Make API docs more automated in terms of discovery. Using `__all__` and/or pointing to modules with things well documented should simplify.
  - Make API docs more automated in terms of integrating the outputs of `quartodoc build` into the site (see the notes in `_quarto.yml`)
- Make pages dynamic that run actual code, rather than static
- Update png logos to the versions with transparency
- Integrate previously external content (e.g. from workshops (2022 Cr-Ni, 2023 Cu-Mg), custom parameters gists)
- Recipes: does it make sense to convert them to be more self-contained, since they use different data?
