## pip (recommended)

To install ESPEI from PyPI using pip:

``` bash
pip install -U pip
pip install -U espei
```

A recommended best practice is to install Python packages into a virtual
environment. To create an environment and install ESPEI on Linux and
macOS/OSX:

``` bash
python -m venv calphad-env
source calphad-env/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -U pycalphad
```

On Windows:

``` batch
python -m venv calphad-env
calphad-env\Scripts\activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -U pycalphad
```

## Anaconda

If you prefer using Anaconda, ESPEI is distributed on conda-forge. If
you do not have Anaconda installed, we recommend you download and
install [Miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
ESPEI can be installed with the conda package manager by:

``` bash
conda install -c conda-forge espei
```

## Development versions {#installing-development-versions}

To make changes to the ESPEI source code, the development version must
be installed. If you\'ll need to make changes to pycalphad
simultaneously, follow the [instructions to install the development
version of
pycalphad](https://pycalphad.org/docs/latest/INSTALLING.html#development-versions-advanced-users)
first.

We strongly recommend that users interested in developing packages work
in a virtual environment. The steps below will create an environment
called `calphad-dev`, which can be entered using
`source calphad-dev/bin/activate` on Linux or macOS/OSX or
`activate calphad-dev\bin\activate` on Windows. The environment name is
arbitrary - you can use whatever name you prefer.

ESPEI uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/PhasesResearchLab/ESPEI) for version
control. Windows users: if you do not have a working version of Git,
[download it here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) first.

To install the latest development version of ESPEI using pip:

``` bash
python -m venv calphad-env
source calphad-env/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/phasesresearchlab/espei.git
cd espei
pip install -U pip
pip install -U --editable .[dev]
```

With the development version installed and your environment activated,
you can run the automated tests by running

``` bash
pytest
```

If the test suite passes, you are ready to start using the development
version or making changes yourself! See the
`guide for contributing to ESPEI <Contributing guide>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to learn more. If any tests fail, please report the failure
to the [ESPEI issue tracker on
GitHub](https://github.com/phasesresearchlab/espei/issues).

To upgrade your development version to the latest version, run
`git pull` from the top level ESPEI directory (the directory containing
the `setup.py` file).
