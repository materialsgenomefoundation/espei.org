## Non-equilibrium Thermochemical Data {#non_equilibrium_thermochemical_data}

Non-equilibrium thermochemical data is used where the internal degrees
of freedom for a phase are known. This type of data is the only data
that can be used for parameter generation, but it can also be used in
Bayesian parameter estimation.

Two examples follow. The first dataset has some data for the formation
heat capacity for BCC_B2.

-   The `components` and `phases` keys simply describe those found in
    this entry.

-   Use the `reference` key for bookkeeping the source of the data.

-   The `comment` key and value can be used anywhere in the data to keep
    notes for your reference. It takes no effect.

-   The `solver` the internal degrees of freedom and and site ratios are
    described for the phase.

    > components in that sublattice. Note that the
    > `sublattice_configurations` is a *list* of these lists. That is,
    > there can be multiple sublattice configurations in a single
    > dataset. See the second example in this section for such an
    > example.

-   The `conditions` describe temperatures (`T`) and pressures (`P`) as
    either scalars or one-dimensional lists.

-   The type of quantity is expressed using the `output` key. This can
    in principle be any thermodynamic quantity, but currently only
    `CPM*`, `SM*`, and `HM*` (where `*` is either nothing, `_MIX` or
    `_FORM`) are supported. Support for changing reference states is
    planned but not yet implemented, so all thermodynamic quantities
    must be formation quantities (e.g. `HM_FORM` or `HM_MIX`, etc.).
    This is tracked by [ESPEI issue #85](https://github.com/phasesresearchlab/espei/issues/85) on GitHub.

-   `values` is a 3-dimensional array where each value is the `output`
    for a specific condition of pressure, temperature, and sublattice
    configurations from outside to inside. Alternatively, the size of
    the array must be `(len(P), len(T), len(subl_config))`. In the
    example below, the shape of the `values` array is (1, 12, 1) as
    there is one pressure scalar, one sublattice configuration, and 12
    temperatures.

-   There is also a key, `excluded_model_contributions`, which will make
    those contributions of pycalphad\'s `Model` not be fit to when doing
    parameter selection or MCMC. This is useful for cases where the type
    of data used does not include some specific `Model` contributions
    that parameters may already exist for. For example, DFT formation
    energies do not include ideal mixing or (Calphad-type) magnetic
    model contributions, but formation energies from experiments would
    include these contributions so experimental formation energies
    should not be excluded.

                [-1.28045],
                [-1.3997 ]]]
}
```

In the second example below, there is formation enthalpy data for
multiple sublattice configurations. All of the keys and values are
conceptually similar. Here, instead of describing how the `output`
quantity changes with temperature or pressure, we are instead only
comparing `HM_FORM` values for different sublattice configurations. The
key differences from the previous example are that there are 9 different
sublattice configurations described by `sublattice_configurations` and
`sublattice_occupancies`. Note that the `sublattice_configurations` and
`sublattice_occupancies` should have exactly the same shape. Sublattices
without mixing should have single strings and occupancies of one.
Sublattices that do have mixing should have a site ratio for each active
component in that sublattice. If the sublattice of a phase is
`["AL", "NI", "VA"]`, it should only have two occupancies if only
`["AL", "NI"]` are active in the sublattice configuration.

The last difference to note is the shape of the `values` array. Here
there is one pressure, one temperature, and 9 sublattice configurations
to give a shape of (1, 1, 9).

## Equilibrium Thermochemical Data

Equilibrium thermochemical data is used when the internal degrees of
freedom are not known. This is typically true for experimental
thermochemical data. Some cases where this type of data is useful,
compared to non-equilibrium thermochemical data are:

1.  Activity data
2.  Enthalpy of formation data in region with two or more phases in
    equilibrium
3.  Enthalpy of formation for a phase with multiple sublattice, e.g. the
    Ïƒ phase

This type of data can not be used in parameter selection, because a core
assumption of parameter selection is that the site fractions are known.

Activity data is similar to non-equilibrium thermochemical data, except
we must enter a reference state and the `solver` key is no longer
required, since we do not know the internal degrees of freedom. A key
detail is that the `phases` key must specify all phases that are
possible to form.

An example for Mg activties in Cu-Mg follows, with data digitized from
S.P. Garg, Y.J. Bhatt, C. V. Sundaram, Thermodynamic study of liquid
Cu-Mg alloys by vapor pressure measurements, Metall. Trans. 4 (1973)
283--289. <doi:10.1007/BF02649628>.

## Phase Diagram Data {#phase_boundary_data}

ESPEI can consider multi-component phase diagram data with an arbitrary
number of phases in equilibrium. Phase diagram data JSON datasets are
distingished by using `"output": "ZPF"`[^1]. Each entry in the JSON
`values` corresponds to a *phase region* where one or more phases are
participating in equilibrium under the given temperature and pressure
conditions.

Each phase in the phase region must give its *phase composition*, i.e.
the internal composition of that phase (*not* the overall composition).
The \"phase composition\" is the same as a \"tie-line composition\" in a
two-phase region of a binary phase diagram, but is a more general term
for cases where the meaning of a tie-line is ambiguous like a single
phase equilibrum or an equilibrium with three or more phases.

Sometimes there may be a phase equilibrium where one or more of the
phase compositions are unknown. This is especially common for phase
diagram data determined by equilibrated alloys or by scanning
calorimetry in binary systems, where one phase composition is
determined, but the phase composition of the other phase(s) in
equilibrium are not. In these cases, phase compositions can be given as
`null` and ESPEI will estimate the phase composition.

::: {.admonition .important}
Important

Each phase region must have at least one phase with a prescribed phase
composition. If all phases in a phase region have `null` phase
compositions, the *target hyperplane* (described by Figure 1 in
[@bocklund2019]) will be undefined and no
driving forces will be computed.
:::

::: {.admonition .important}
Important

For a dataset with `c` components, each phase composition must be
specified by `c-1` components. There is an implicit `N=1` condition.

### Example

``` JSON
{
  "components": ["AL", "NI"],
  "phases": ["AL3NI2", "BCC_B2", "LIQUID"],
  "conditions": {
    "P": 101325,
     "T": [2500, 1348, 1176, 977]
  },
  "output": "ZPF",
  "values": [
    [["LIQUID", ["NI"], [0.5]]],
    [["AL3NI2", ["NI"], [0.4083]], ["BCC_B2", ["NI"], [0.4340]]],
    [["AL3NI2", ["NI"], [0.4114]], ["BCC_B2", ["NI"], [null]]],
    [["BCC_B2", ["NI"], [0.71]], ["LIQUID", ["NI"], [0.752]], ["FCC_L12", ["NI"], [0.76]]]
  ],
  "reference": "37ALE"
}
```

Each entry in the `values` list is a list of all phases in equilibrium
in a phase region. There are four phase regions:

`[["LIQUID", ["NI"], [0.5]]]`

:   Single phase equilibrium with `LIQUID` having a phase composition of
    `X(NI,LIQUID)=0.5`.

`[["AL3NI2", ["NI"], [0.4083]], ["BCC_B2", ["NI"], [0.4340]]]`

:   Two phase equilibrium between `AL3NI2` and `BCC_B2`, which have
    phase compositions of `X(NI,AL3NI2)=0.4083` and
    `X(NI,BCC_B2)=0.4340`, respectively.

`[["AL3NI2", ["NI"], [0.4114]], ["BCC_B2", ["NI"], [null]]]`

:   Two phase equilibrium between `AL3NI2` and `BCC_B2` where the phase
    composition of `BCC_B2` is unknown.

`[["BCC_B2", ["NI"], [0.71]], ["LIQUID", ["NI"], [0.752]], ["FCC_L12", ["NI"], [0.76]]]`

:   Eutectic reaction between `LIQUID`, `BCC_B2` and `FCC_L12`.

::: {.admonition .Tip}
Tip: Multi-component phase regions

To describe multi-component phase regions, simply include more
components and compositions in each phase composition. For example, a
two-phase equilibrium in a three component system could be described by
`[["ALPHA", ["CR", "NI"], [0.1, 0.25]], ["BETA", ["CR", "NI"], [null, null]]]`

## Tags

Tags are a flexible method to adjust many ESPEI datasets simultaneously
and drive them via the ESPEI\'s input YAML file. Each dataset can have a
`"tags"` key, with a corresponding value of a list of tags, e.g.
`["dft"]`. Any tag modifications present in the input YAML file are
applied to the datasets before ESPEI is run.

They can be used in many creative ways, but some suggested ways include
to add weights or to exclude model contributions, e.g. for DFT data that
should not have contributions for a Calphad magnetic model or ideal
mixing energy. An example of using the tags in an input file looks like:

``` JSON
{
  "components": ["CR", "FE", "VA"],"phases": ["BCC_A2"],
  "solver": {"mode": "manual", "sublattice_site_ratios": [1, 3],
             "sublattice_configurations": [[["CR", "FE"], "VA"]],
  "sublattice_occupancies": [[[0.5, 0.5], 1.0]]},
  "conditions": {"P": 101325, "T": 300},
  "output": "HM_MIX",
  "values": [[[10000]]],
  "tags": ["dft"]
}
```

An example input YAML looks like

``` YAML
system:
  phase_models: CR-FE.json
  datasets: FE-NI-datasets-sep
  tags:
    dft:
      excluded_model_contributions: ["idmix", "mag"]

generate_parameters:
  excess_model: linear
  ref_state: SGTE91
  ridge_alpha: 1.0e-20
output:
  verbosity: 2
  output_db: out.tdb
```

This will add the key `"excluded_model_contributions"` to all datasets
that have the `"dft"` tag:

``` JSON
{
  "components": ["CR", "FE", "VA"],"phases": ["BCC_A2"],
  "solver": {"mode": "manual", "sublattice_site_ratios": [1, 3],
             "sublattice_configurations": [[["CR", "FE"], "VA"]],
  "sublattice_occupancies": [[[0.5, 0.5], 1.0]]},
  "conditions": {"P": 101325, "T": 300},
  "output": "HM_MIX",
  "values": [[[10000]]],
  "excluded_model_contributions": ["idmix", "mag"]
}
```

## Common Mistakes and Notes

1.  A single element sublattice is different in a phase model
    (`[["A", "B"], ["A"]]]`) than a sublattice configuration
    (`[["A", "B"], "A"]`).
2.  Make sure you use the right units (`J/mole-atom`, mole fractions,
    Kelvin, Pascal)
3.  Mixing configurations should not have ideal mixing contributions.
4.  All types of data can have a `weight` key at the top level that will
    weight the standard deviation parameter in MCMC runs for that
    dataset. If a single dataset should have different weights applied,
    multiple datasets should be created.

[^1]: `ZPF` after the \"Zero Phase Fraction\" method
    [@bocklund2019] used to compute the
    likelihood. \"Zero phase fraction\" is a little misleading as a
    name, since the prescribed phase compositions in the datasets
    actually correspond to the overall composition where the phase
    fraction of the desired phase should be *one*.
